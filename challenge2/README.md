# QED Quickly! #

Suppose every odd natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of a prime number and 2 times a square as seen below:


### k = p + 2 * (n)^2 ###


Where k is an odd number, p is a prime, and n is some integer. For example:

---

`9 = 7 + 2 * (1)^2`
	
`27 = 19 + 2 * (2)^2`

`43 = 43 + 2 * (0)^2`

`93474253 = 93425581 + 2 * (156)^2`

---

And so on until infinity. We have a sneaking suspicion this might be false and we need you to prove it through contradiction!

## Your Task

Create an algorithm to find as many odd numbers as possible to disprove the above expression. The more numbers you find, the better your score will be!

**Please submit the numbers you believe to contradict this conjecture in a .txt file, see `example.txt` for general formatting.**
