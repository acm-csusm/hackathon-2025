# QED Quickly!

There's a madman roaming the halls of Science Hall 2 with a crazy conjecture. He claims that every odd natural number greater than `1` can be written as the sum of a prime number and `2` times a square as seen below:

`O = p + 2 * (n)^2`


Where `O` is an odd number greater than `1`, `p` is a prime number, and `n` is an integer. However, you have a feeling this might not be true... 

## Your Task

Find as many odd numbers as you can to disprove this hypothesis. Display your findings using a function that is as efficient as possible. You should not skip over any solutions.
