# Speakhard to Speakeasy

You've recently been hired by a company. The catch? It's run by defrosted cavemen from the Paleolithic era. They're quite upset with the state of language currently. The CEO, Crug Grood, is aways saying, "Why many word? Less word make easy," while swinging his club about with fervor. 

## Your Task

To make his life easier, create a translator to optimize English, cutting as much as you deem reasonable from the language while still maintaining the meaning of the sentence. Use the following sentences often heard around the office as your inputs:

#### Social Interactions:
**"Allen has mistaken me for his friend Marcus Halberstam. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut."**

#### Sales Pitches
**"As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody wanna see second prize? Second prize's a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired."**

#### Budget Talks
**"The good news is Vinnie, you're not going to care cause you're gonna make so much money. That's what I get out of it. Wanna know what you get out of it? You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana and the nuts. Right now I get the sprinkles, and you- if this goes through, I get the cherry. But you get the sundae, Vinny. You get the sundae."**

#### Legal Troubles
**"And I'll bet what you hated the most was that they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook, which I am. You better lawyer up asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30%, I'm coming back for everything."**

#### Fatherly Advice
**"Because the man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead. Be liked and you will never want. I never have to wait in line to see a buyer."**

The rules are a bit looser for this challenge; just use your best judgement to make sure Crug Grood understands the above inputs and optimize them as efficiently as possible. There is no one correct answer for either input!

Here's an example with a different input:

Input: **"Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drown. The second mouse wouldnâ€™t quite. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse"**

Output: **"Two small mice fall in big milk. First mouse quit, drown. Second mouse fight, make butter, crawl out. Me second mouse!"**
