Romans to Numerals

These super bowls number are getting way too long! What does super bowl LX even mean?!

In the most optimal way possible, create a converter for Roman numerals to regular numbers. I, V, X, L, C, D and M are the possible digits in a roman numeral. I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L is 50, C is 100, D is 500, M is 1000. 

2 is II, 3 is III, and so on. However, 4 is IV, because V is 5 and 5 - 1 is 4. This subtraction can occur as such:

* I before V or I before X making 4 and 9, respectively
* X before L and X before C making 40 and 90, respectively.
* C before D and C before M making 400 and 900. 

Examples:

1. In: IV, out: 4, because 5 - 1 is 4. 
2. In: LX, out: 60, because 50 + 10 is 60.
3. In: XCIX, out: 99, because 100 - 10 - 1 + 10 is 99. 

Solve as efficiently as possible.
