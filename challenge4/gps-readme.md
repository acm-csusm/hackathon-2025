# I Know a Shortcut!

You're a First year student with an unfortunate schedule. Somehow you got a class in every building on campus: Science Hall 1, Academic Hall, Markstein Hall, University Hall, Social and Behavioral Science Building, Science Hall 2, and Extended Learning Building. Not only are they all over the place, they're also all on the top floors of each building. Being a first year, you're not crushed by this fact and decide this is the perfect opportunity to find the most perfect route between all the buildings.

By any means necessary and assuming you're only sticking to walkable paths (no cutting through bushes or scaling walls) find the shortest and fastest route between the top floors of each building on campus. Take into accounts X, Y, and Z when finding this route. Give your answer in meters.
