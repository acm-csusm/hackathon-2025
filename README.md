# CSUSM ACM Hackathon 2025!

Welcome to the first ever ACM Hackathon here at CSU San Marcos! In this repository, we have all the information that you need to get started on our 4 challenges. Remember, you don't need to solve everthing. Start with the challenges you can do, and work from there. Submit what you have, even if it's not completed! It's still better than nothing. 

When grading submissions, we'll be looking for these four main things: efficiency/compute speed, team work, code quality/practicality, and the effectiveness of the solution. Ask questions if you need help, and have fun! 

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Please clone the folders into your repository, work on the problems on your own machines

2. All files must be written in either **C++** or **Python**

3. Refer to formatting files (if included) to print your outputs

4. Submissions must include a writeup of the challenge of at least 100 words describing your process, decisions, and collaborations. Submit [here](https://forms.office.com/r/EpznHcui5b).

5. Any additional questions please email **rodri1582@csusm.edu**, **avdey001@csusm.edu**, **acm.csu.san.marcos@gmail.com**

## RULES:
1. Have fun

2. Submit all solutions by 4/16 at 2:00 PM PST, no solutions will be taken after this time

3. Frequent use of chatGPT is not recommended, this is supposed to flex your coding muscles not your "prompt engineering" skills

4. Do not share solutions with other teams

5. Please get along with your team mates

6. Do not ask professors or any code sharing site for solutions (ie posting the problem), ***Anyone found violating this rule will be disqualified***
