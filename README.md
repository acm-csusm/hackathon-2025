# CSUSM ACM Hackathon 2025!

Welcome to the first ever ACM Hackathon here at CSU San Marcos! In this repository, we have all the information that you need to get started on our 4 challenges. Remember, you don't need to solve everthing. Start with the challenges you can do, and work from there. Submit what you have, even if it's not completed! It's still better than nothing. 

When grading submissions, we'll be looking for these four main things: efficiency/compute speed, team work, code quality/practicality, and the effectiveness of the solution. Ask questions if you need help, and have fun!
